# LogHawk
Project 3 - Introducing LogHawk: a script-based log analysis tool designed to quickly scan logs for security threats, system errors, and unusual activity.
LogHawk can scan for too many failed attempts, unusual traffic spikes, critical system errors, and suspicious script activity.


# Installation Steps 
LogHawk only utilizes bash, so there's no need to download any new compiler.
